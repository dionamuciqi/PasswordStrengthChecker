# Password Strength Checker


## Project Overview:

This Password Strength Checker tool was developed as part of an Internet Security Course. It serves as a web-based application that allows users to check the strength of their passwords in real-time. It provides visual feedback on the strength of the password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Project Idea:
The idea behind this project is to create a tool that helps users create strong and secure passwords by providing immediate feedback on the strength of their chosen passwords. By visually indicating which password conditions are met and the overall strength of the password, users can make informed decisions about their password choices.

## Project Implementation:
### Project Structure:
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: CSS file containing styles for the web page.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for password strength calculation and UI interaction.

### Key Features:
- Real-time password strength checking.
- Visual indication of password strength and met conditions.
- Responsive design for use on various devices.

### Dependencies:
- Bootstrap 4.3.1: CSS framework for styling.
- jQuery 3.3.1: JavaScript library for DOM manipulation.
- Popper.js 1.14.7: Dependency for Bootstrap's tooltips and popovers.

### Project Flow:
1. When the user enters a password in the input field, the JavaScript code calculates the strength of the password based on various criteria.
2. The password strength is visually represented using a progress bar, and the met conditions are highlighted.
3. The user receives immediate feedback on the strength of their password and can adjust it accordingly.

### Deployed Link:
